# A simple 404 page (with a tiny bit extra)...
A 404 page with a bunch of hidden Easter eggs. Click random keys in random orders, type in common words, and click in interesting places. <br>
It uses express for a backend, vanilla HTML, css, and JS on the frontend.<br>
It also uses Bootstrap and Jquery in some pages, and I got some help from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Bounce_off_the_walls and https://darkcssweb.com/eyes-follow-mouse/ for two of the easter eggs.
